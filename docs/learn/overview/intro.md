# Introduction to Optimum

**Optimum** is the world’s first decentralized, network communiation  and  high-performance shared memory infrastructure
for any blockchain — built to do low-latency gossip around geographically distrbuted nodes, to scale data access, reduce network congestion, and power the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps). 
Powered by **Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC)** — a cutting-edge data encoding technique developed under the supervision of 
Professor Muriel Medard, EECS, MIT. 
By leveraging RLNC, Optimum transforms slow, redundant peer-to-peer networks into fast, efficient, and scalable communication layers.

Optimum is a decentralized network of **flexnodes** that can be run by anyone and
permissionlessly connect to any blockchain.

With Optimum, blockchains gain a **memory bus and RAM** that rivals the performance
of modern computing. At its core, Optimum is building a provably optimal memory
infrastructure that transforms blockchains into high-speed, scalable computing
networks. The architecture is modular, permissionless, and easy to integrate via
developer-friendly APIs.

## Optimum Products

Optimum is realeasing its product [**Optimum P2P**](./p2p.md) and soon be followed by **DeROM** (Decentralized Read Only Memory),  ([**DeRAM** (Decentralized Random Access Memory)](./deram.md) - bring measurable improvements across the entire blockchain stack:

* **For L1 and L2 blockchains**: 
  Accelerated block propagation, reduced bandwidth usage, and optimized on-chain storage.
* **For Validators**:
   Faster data propagation, reduced operational overhead, and increased rewards through higher APY and MEV.  
* **For dApp developers**: 
  Improved transaction relay and prioritization — enabling latency-sensitive, high-throughput, and cost-aware applications.
* **For end users**: 
  Faster transactions, faster confirmations, and smoother interfaces — enhancing overall user experience.
