# Introduction to Optimum

Optimum is the world’s first decentralized, high-performance memory infrastructure
for any blockchain — designed to scale data access, reduce network strain, and
power the next generation of dApps. Powered by Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC)
— a proven, MIT-developed data encoding technique — Optimum turns sluggish,
redundant networks into fast, efficient, scalable systems.

Optimum is a decentralized network of flexnodes that can be run by anyone and
permissionlessly connect to any blockchain.

With Optimum, blockchains gain a memory bus and RAM that rivals the performance
of modern computing. At its core, Optimum is building a provably optimal memory
infrastructure that transforms blockchains into high-speed, scalable computing
networks. The architecture is modular, permissionless, and easy to integrate via
APIs.

Optimum's products include Optimum P2P and decentralized Random Access Memory -
DeRAM that deliver benefits across the entire blockchain ecosystem:

* **For validators**: Accelerated data propagation, lower operational costs,
  higher APY and MEV income
* **For L1 and L2 blockchains**: Faster block propagation, reduced bandwidth
  consumption, and optimized storage
* **For dApp developers**: Improved transaction relay and prioritization,
  enabling latency, throughput, and cost-sensitive apps
* **For end users**: Faster transactions and more responsive interfaces, improving
  user experience
