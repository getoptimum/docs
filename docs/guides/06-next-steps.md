# Next Steps

You’ve installed OptimumP2P, sent your first messages, tuned key parameters, and explored monitoring.  
Now it’s time to take your deployment further — integrating it into your projects, scaling for real-world scenarios, and experimenting with advanced setups.


## 1. Integrate with Your Application

Depending on your architecture, you can connect your app to OptimumP2P in one of two main ways:

* **Direct P2P Client**
    * Use gRPC to connect directly to P2P nodes.
    * Best for low-latency, high-throughput scenarios.
    * Requires your app to manage peer discovery and reconnections.

* **Proxy + P2P**
    * Connect via REST or gRPC to a proxy that bridges to the P2P mesh.
    * Best for web clients, services without native P2P support, or multi-node orchestration.
    * Lets you centralize authentication, logging, and metrics.

See: [Client Integration Guide](./02-getting-started-docker.md)


## 2. Experiment with Advanced Configurations

* **RLNC Tuning**
    * Increase `OPTIMUM_SHARD_FACTOR` for higher fault tolerance.
    * Lower `OPTIMUM_THRESHOLD` for faster forwarding.
    * Observe trade-offs between redundancy, latency, and bandwidth.

* **Mesh Topology**
    * Test sparse (`MESH_TARGET=4`) vs dense (`MESH_TARGET=10`) topologies.
    * Use multiple bootstrap nodes to reduce single points of failure.

* **Protocol Comparisons**
    * Run identical workloads on OptimumP2P and GossipSub.
    * Measure latency, message loss recovery, and CPU/memory usage.


## 3. Deploy in a Distributed Environment

* Test across multiple regions for realistic latency.
* Use cloud instances (AWS, GCP, Azure) with Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
* Secure nodes using:
    * Private bootstrap peers
    * TLS for gRPC
    * Firewall rules for P2P ports

## 4. Contribute to OptimumP2P

* Submit improvements or bug reports.
* Share performance results from different configurations.
* Contribute new client libraries or example integrations.


## 5. Plan for Upcoming Features

Watch for:

* **DeRAM Integration** — Optimized memory handling for large datasets.
* **Blockchain-Specific Integration** — Direct integration with Ethereum, Solana, and others.
* many more..
