# Technical Papers

Optimum’s breakthrough in decentralized memory infrastructure is built on 15 years
of pioneering work in network coding. Led by Prof. Muriel Medard (Co-founder & CEO),
co-inventor of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC), and driven by
Dr. Kishori Konwar (Co-founder & CTO) in distributed systems and coding theory,
our technology redefines data handling in blockchain networks. Prof. Nancy Lynch (Advisor),
whose work on Byzantine Fault Tolerance and influence on Tendermint—along with
her tenure as MIT’s NEC Chair of Software Science and Engineering before
Prof. Medard—further anchors our foundation in resilient, secure systems.

The papers below highlight how network coding advances both functional
capabilities (storage, access, and propagation) and system properties
(security, robustness, and attack resistance), forming the technical backbone of
Optimum’s scalable solution for Web3.
